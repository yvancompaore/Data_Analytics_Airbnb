Tab 1 (Analysis 1 – Comparing cities) :

o Select the cities he would like to compare among the list of cities you already have.
o Select a feature that he would like to compare (availability over last 30 days, revenue, price …).
o Select the aggregation type / plot type (average, median, histogram, density, boxplot …)
o Have more granularity to your insights by allowing for the possibility of addition of new dimensions to the plot (room type / no bedrooms, neighborhood…), so that your plot can now plot the histogram of revenue over both the different cities and different room types for instance.

o Select the city he would like to analyze.
o Display the finer grained analysis.
